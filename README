The purpose of this software suite is to apply noisification and denoisification methods on astronomical light curves.

to do

:data:
contains raw data (light curves) from several surveys

:data_analysis:
mostly R code used for analyzing data in the data_processed folders. functions for running classifiers, EDA, ect.

:data_processed:
code in src outputs files that can be read into R. usually files with features and files with time,flux,error measurements for light curves

:db:
light curves are moved from data folder and put into databases where they can be manipulated. db holds these databases. most are created by code in src folder

:reports:
reports written up based on results of data_analysis

:src:
python source code for getting light curves into data bases, noisifying light curves, outputting results in data_processed
