to do

- setup python in batch on the scf
  - nohup nice -19 R --slave < in.R > R.out 2>&1 &
  - see: http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/790
  - seems to work: nohup python2.7 demo.txt > demo_results.txt &
  	- takes demo_results.txt a while to update
- a try / except for import python modules folder (for beautiful soup on scf)
  - should just add this to demo.txt or whatever python script we use to call
  	everything else
- determine classes and counts of different classes from debosscher and ASAS
