for making nice plots of sources from Hipparcos and OGLE which are used in dissertation and job talk.

there is a bit of data processing that goes on to make these. Specifically:

photometry files from data/OGLEIII and data/hipparcos_dubath are processed by src/interp_lc_plots.R. feature and tfe files are output. the photometry files in data/hipparcos_dubath unfortunately are all are erroneously labeled as Beta Lyrae(why is this the case?). so to get the correct classes we use the dubath_features file (in this folder, obtained from email correspondence with Pierre Dubath) and merge this with the derived features (linking records by hipparcos ID number)
